> Use Python, SQL, statistics, and Machine Learning to uncover insights and make predictions, communicate critical findings clearly, and create data-driven solutions

## Skills Acquired (Summary)


### Prerequisites

You'll need to install:

* [Python (3.x or higher)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

And additional libraries defined in each project.

Recommended:

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

## Project Overview
### Explore Weather Trends

First chapter project was about weather trends - it required to apply (atleast) the following steps:
* Extracted the data from database using SQL
* Calculate a moving average
* Create a line chart 

I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends in Copenhagen to overall global temperature trends.

**Key findings**:
- the average global temperature is increasing, with an also increasing tempo
- Before 1900, both two tempo showed the similar trends. However, the average tempo of Copenhagen is more fluctuant than that of the world after 1900

### Investigate TMdb Movie Dataset

This project included therefore all steps of the typical data analysis process. This includes:
- posing questions
- gather, wrangle and clean data 
- communicate answers to the questions 
- assited through visualizations and statistics. 

Here we were confronted with the full joy of a real-life dataset: from hard-to-analyze structure, missing, messy, dirty data to real and - after finally being done with data wrangling - the reward of interesting insights. 

### Analyze A/B Test Results

The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. It includes:
- Analyzed the converting rate of the new page   
- Conducted hypothesis test using different approaches: bootstrapping, Z-test and logistic regression modeling with statsmodels

### Gather, Clean and Analyze Twitter Data (WeRateDogs™ (@dog_rates))

In this project we had to deal with the reality of dirty and messy data (again).
- Gathered data from different sources (for example the Twitter API), identified issues with the dataset in terms of tidiness and quality   
- Performed data cleaning and the exploration of the data.

### Communicate Data Findings

The task of the final project was to analyze and visualize real-world data. I chose the Ford GoBike dataset.    
- Conduct an exploratory data analysis on a dataset, which explores the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships(from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships).   
- Take your main findings from your exploration and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis.
- Create a slide deck that leverages polished, explanatory visualizations to communicate your results.
